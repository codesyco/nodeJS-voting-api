# nodeJS-voting-api

The API was built using Node.js and Express.js, a popular web framework for NodeJS.

MongoDB will be used as the database to store the voting data.

Express will handle routing and middleware functionality, while MongoDB will handle data storage and retrieval.

The API follows a RESTful architecture to provide endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting voting data.
